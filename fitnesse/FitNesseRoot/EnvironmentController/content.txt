!3 Requirements
The Environment Controller keeps a computer room within a closely controlled temperature range by using both a heater and a cooler.
 * The temperature must never deviate more than 5 degrees from 70F.
 * If the temperature is ever more than 10 degrees away from 70F then the appropriate Hi or Lo alarm must sound.
 * When the heater is on, the blower must be on.
 * When the cooler is on, the blower must be on.
 * The blower must continue to run for 5 minutes after the heater is turned off
  * Because the heat exchanger has latent heat that must not be allowed to accumulate lest it melt the sensitive vanes.
 * The cooler must not be turned on within 3 minutes of being turned off
  * Because the freon must be given time to recondense lest the compressor vapor lock.

!3 Finite State Machine for Environment Controller
 * Settling = The time that the blower must be on in order to cool down the heat exchanger
 * Relaxing = The time the compressor must remain off to prevent vapor lock
